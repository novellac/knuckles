# Welcome!

This is where the styles for this project live. If you add additional partials, be sure to note them in the `main.scss` file.

## How do I use this?

When you clone this project, you should go into the root of the project and run `npm i`. This will install the necessary packages. So far it is only SASS, and I'll try to keep it light.
Once you have installed, you can run the following command. This should start "watching" the SCSS files and compiling them into CSS:
`sass --watch scss/main.scss:css/styles.css`

## Why no framework?

This is a single page app, and I am not betting on it being complicated (or even finished, lol).
I am not interested in keeping a framework up to date, so I'm neither making one nor using one from elsewhere. :shrug:

## Tiny project, why so many folders?

Having more files helps me structure my thought. Plus, it leaves clues for future me to know where styles might live!

## What resources did you use to structure this project?
