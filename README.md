# Name your knuckles!

### A fun, not-for-real knuckle tattoo generator

This app is a random word generator, generating silly, not-for-real suggestions for knuckle tattoos.
_Please do not take these suggestions seriously._
_There is no list of stopwords, and as such, offensive words may result._
_These words don't represent my opinions. I don't really think you should use my app to generate a knuckle tattoo for yourself._

## But like, _why_?

I wanted to teach myself more about Fetch and Javascript promises. I also like silly word pairings. Plus I can dress it up a little and make it super cute.

## This is awesome can I help?

You are welcome to submit an issue for new features, but I make no guarantees!

## I found bad words!

Yeahhhh these are two four-letter words being generated. I may someday make a list of stopwords, but today is not that day.

## What's next?

I'm so glad you asked!
